# Python-RE-XED

I wrote a Python wrapper for my Reverse Engineering Assignment that let me analyze PE files by launching Intel's x86 Encoder/Decoder.  This takes an executable and then decodes the instructions and converts them into their assembly representation from the binary instructions. This also provides a hex dump and all of the operations that the processor is given in assembly.

Inside is a report, the program, and the disassembling tool I used to make all of it.

It's a pretty neat thing that helps you understand assembly and processor architecture.
